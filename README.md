# Modeling-Non-Stationarity-and-Finding-an-Equilibrium

In financial markets, the behavior of asset prices often shows non-stationarity, posing challenges for econometric modeling and prediction. As such, identifying equilibrium relationships among non-stationary time series becomes important for understanding long-term co-movements and short-term deviations. Thus, this project focuses on Modeling Non-Stationarity and Finding an Equilibrium through the application of cointegration techniques and Error Correction Models (ECM). Using real-world financial datasets, we demonstrate how cointegrated stock prices reveal both long-term equilibrium and short-term fluctuations, providing valuable insights for trading strategies and risk management. The analysis involves a systematic approach: testing for stationarity, validating cointegration with econometric tests, calibrating model parameters, and evaluating residual diagnostics to ensure model adequacy. By applying the ECM framework, particularly to the relationship between Visa and Mastercard, the project highlights how deviations from equilibrium can be corrected over time, offering a rigorous econometric foundation for forecasting and investment decision-making.
